## Features

Hospitality Hunt allows freelancers to fill in a profile, including what sector they want to work in, what type of contract they are looking for and to take a photo of themselves through their webcam.

Freelancers then have access to a list of available jobs matching their profile. They can search for jobs in a restricted perimeter around their area based on their postcode.

Businesses can also fill in a profile detailing their activity and can post one or several job listings, which they can edit or delete when needed.

They have access to a list of freelancers who match their reseach criteria.
